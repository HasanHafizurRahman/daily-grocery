# Daily Grocery is multi-vendor POINT OF SALE application

## I used reactjs in the frontend , expressjs for backend , mongodb for database, react-redux for state-management , react-router-dom for routing , ant design for component design, mongoose for schema design .

 
### User can buy the grocery items from the application
